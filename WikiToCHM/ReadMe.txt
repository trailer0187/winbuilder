These are the templates for the windows help compiler.

Add in all the HTML files generated by the script file that extracts the wiki files and 
does the "fix" necessary.

Given the way the google wiki works, we have modified the standard google-code-wiki-to-html 
so that it USES the sidebar navigation (afterall, it is the master navigation) and also 
removes a few of the items (like last modified and the colapse of the sidebar).

Run the Script to generate the help directory and extract all the HTML...The java is packaged
win jsmooth, so it should find a workable java runtime.

Then the script will go into the win-help directory to use HTML HELP Workshop to build the CHM,
and then package it into a 7z file as well.

Verify the project (i.e. the CHM) is OK, and upload to site.

To clean up, just remove the Win-Help directory...(or run script :-)
